# My Dotfiles

Zach Holman: "Your dotfiles are how you personalize your system. These are mine."

I decided to put up my dotfiles one because sharing is caring, but the more obvious two is I was
tired of people asking me "Where did you get that?" "How did you do that?"

## Installation

After forking or downloading the dotfiles you can install them to $HOME with install.sh
Alternatively they can be symlinked to $HOME with symlink.sh
