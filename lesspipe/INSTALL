INSTALL
=======
Execute the following commands (for a more detailed description see below):

  ./configure
  cp lesspipe.sh sxw2txt code2color tarcolor /usr/local/bin

or if you prefer make:

  make
  make test
  make install

Then do set the environment variable LESSOPEN:

  LESSOPEN="|/usr/local/bin/lesspipe.sh %s"; export LESSOPEN  #(sh like shells)
  setenv LESSOPEN "|/usr/local/bin/lesspipe.sh %s"            #(csh, tcsh)

  DO NOT OMIT THE VERTICAL BAR AS FIRST CHARACTER, IT IS ESSENTIAL !!!

Detailed description
====================

Prerequisites:
--------------
For a detailed discussion consult the file README starting with the section
'Required programs'. For best results up to date versions of 'file' (4.17 or
later), tar, gzip, bzip2 and the programs antiword, html2text and o3tohtml are
highly recommended.

Step 1: recreate lesspipe.sh and Makefile (optional)
----------------------------------------------------
To verify a working system and to customize lesspipe.sh to your needs
recreate lesspipe.sh from lesspipe.sh.in (and Makefile) by the command

 ./configure [--help] [--ask|--default|--fixed|--yes] [--nomake]
	[--prefix=<path>] [--shell=<file>]

Options:
  --help                  print this message
  --ask                   ask questions when running make (this is the default
                          for configure but without --ask it is not for make)
  --default               do not ask questions, try to guess correct answer
  --yes                   like --default but assume 'yes' to all questions
  --fixed                 like --yes but use preconfigured answer (see below)
  --shell=<filename>      specify full path to an alternative shell to use
  --nomake                do not generate a Makefile
Directory and file names:
  --prefix=PREFIX         install lesspipe.sh in PREFIX/bin (/usr/local)

configure generates by default both lesspipe.sh and Makefile
configure tries to find required and optional programs for lesspipe.sh
If optional programs are not found, then you can choose between
  - giving the correct location of the program if installed
  - including the code in lesspipe.sh without having the program
  - or skipping the code for the missing program.
Answers to the questions can be preconfigured by modifying the data section
in configure after the __END__ line. For missing data use the default answer

The recreation of lesspipe.sh can also be achieved by using the supplied or
regenerated Makefile with the command

  make [MODE=--ask|--default|--fixed|--yes] [PREFIX=<path>]

where the optional parameters MODE and PREFIX correspond to the configure
options described above. Forcing the use of a specific shell is not possible.

##  Please note that the activation of syntax highlighting can slow down
##  the display of plain files noticeably.
##  An alternative to using less with syntax highlighting is the use of vim
##  with the macro less.vim. A script less.sh is usually coming with vim
##  that does emulate less and has syntax highlighting. 

Step 2: verify that lesspipe.sh is working correctly (optional)
---------------------------------------------------------------
A test suite has been added that does cover complicated use cases of less
where bugs have been fixed recently. Attempts are made to add normal use
cases as well. If the test suite reports "NOT ok" lines then lesspipe.sh
is probably not fully functional in your environment. If the message is
"NOT ok (ignored)" it is usually an indication that some helper programs are
not installed. To execute the test suite the command

  make test
or
  ./test.pl [-d]

can be used. The option -d is for debugging. In case of errors please read
the file testok/README. Make sure your file command is sufficiently recent.
Otherwise not all file formats will be recognized correctly.

To get support for newer file types an additional magic file (e.g. ~/.magic,
for use in the file command) might have to be created. In that case the
environment variable MAGIC has to be set and has to contain both the system
magic file and your personal one. Example:

  MAGIC='/usr/share/file/magic:/Users/myaccount/.magic'
  export MAGIC

Step 3: install lesspipe.sh, code2color, sxw2txt and tarcolor
-------------------------------------------------------------
You can copy lesspipe.sh to any appropriate place.
Suggested location: /usr/local/bin/lesspipe.sh
The helper programs can be copied to the same directory as lesspipe.sh or any
directory listed in the PATH environment variable. The program sxw2txt is
required for decoding Openoffice and OpenDocument (OASIS) documents, if
o3tohtml is not installed. The tarcolor script allows to colorize tar listings.

  cp lesspipe.sh code2color sxw2txt tarcolor /usr/local/bin

This can be achieved also with make:

  make install [PREFIX=<path>]  # that copies the scripts to <path>/bin

Step 4: activate lesspipe.sh
----------------------------
To make use of the installed lesspipe.sh set the environment variable LESSOPEN:
I recommend to use the fully qualified path to avoid problems with other
scripts of the same name or with a changed search PATH:

  LESSOPEN="|/usr/local/bin/lesspipe.sh %s"; export LESSOPEN  #(sh like shells)
  setenv LESSOPEN "|/usr/local/bin/lesspipe.sh %s"	      #(csh, tcsh)

If syntax highlighting is activated in the script then to actually see
highlighted or colored code less has to be called with option -r or -R!

If lesspipe.sh was generated respecting the ENV var LESS_ADVANCED_PREPROCESSOR
then html, ps, rtf files as well as files with foreign charsets get only
preprocessed if that variable is set. This way the user can control the amount
of file filtering himself.

Generated lesspipe.sh and Makefile in the package
=================================================
the supplied files were generated with the settings from configure
(after the __END__ line), that is everything enabled i.e. syntax highlighting
and the LESS_ADVANCED_PREPROCESSOR code is included.

  ./configure --fixed
