Open requests/proposals
=======================
displaying HTML on the Mac using lynx seems not to be working, I received a
patch to correct that and use elinks as the preferred viewer. It needs to be
checked and probably included in a coming version

On the same line I got a different patch to use elinks for better coloring the
HTML output. As there are differences btween MacOS and Linux this needs careful checking before making changes. This is deferred as well.

Man page install location
=========================

At the moment the man page will be installed only in the directory
$PREFIX/share/man/man1 if it is existing. Needs to be more sophisticated.

Recognition of correct file type
================================

The correct file type is not always recognized by using the 'file' command.
This may be due to old versions of 'file'. The support for Openoffice files
e.g. is not contained in 'magic files' from file-4.16 or older.
In addition there are ambiguities, so that an UTF-16 file may be reported as
MPEG ADTS, layer I, v1 file. This could be corrected by supplying a magic file
tailored to the needs of lesspipe. Such a file could be provided.
